running linuxcnc on fedora requires kernel-rt unless running only in simulation mode.

source rpms for kernel-rt can be obtained and built on your platform from:
http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/mirror/fedora/linux/planetcore/22/SRPMS/

or you can install the planet ccrma repos and install the prebuilt rpm
